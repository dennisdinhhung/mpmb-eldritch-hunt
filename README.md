# Steinhardt's Guide to the Eldritch Hunt addon for MPMB Chracter Sheet

This git repository holds different fan-created materials that can be used with **MorePurpleMoreBetter's D&D 5e Character Record Sheet**. The repository for the sheet is [found on MPMB's GitHub](https://github.com/morepurplemorebetter/MPMBs-Character-Record-Sheet).

## How to use

1. Download the latest version of the PDF from [MPMB's website](https://www.flapkan.com/#download).
2. Download the All in One file, and save it somewhere on your machine. (Alternaively, download the individual files and import them if needed)
3. Open the PDF and click on the bookmark **Functions** >> **Add Extra Materials**.
4. From the menu that appears, select the option **Import a file with additional material**.
5. In the dialog that opens, click **Add file**, and open the file you saved in step 1.
6. Click **Apply changes** in the Import Files dialog and the sheet will process the file you added. You will get a pop-up message if it was successful or not.

MPMB has a more flashy explanation, along with a video, on how to do this in [this how-to guide on his website](https://www.flapkan.com/how-to/add-more-content).
